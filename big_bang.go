    In this exercise you will implement a text search engine.
    You can use one store object with any data structure that suits your idea.
    The tests are divided into steps, please pass each step at a time, but keep previous steps working.
    Try to complete as much steps as you can but keep in mind the complexity and quality of your solution.
    Few tips before you go:
    We suggest you to read all tests and assert messages before you start implementing, it will save you some time in the advanced steps.
	Feel free to install and impoort any external package that might help you!
