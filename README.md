# Sygnia's Backend Dev Task

Hi!  
We hope the process is going well for you so far.

Please follow the instructions below, and don't hesitate to ask us for anything you need.

## Instructions

1. Go to [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/)

2. Set [https://github.com/SygniaLabs/backend-dev-task](https://github.com/SygniaLabs/backend-dev-task) as the GitHub repository URL and hit launch

3. Open `the_big_bang.ipynb` and follow the instructions there (there are also stub versions for Node (big_bang.js) and Go (big_bang.go), you can choose based on your preferred toolset)

4. Once you are done, download the notebook file as .ipynb, or take the relevant go/js file and send it to: `michael.h@sygnia.co`

5. If for some reason you are having hard time working with Binder, you can always download `the_big_bang.py` and work locally in your favorite IDE!

### Good luck!
